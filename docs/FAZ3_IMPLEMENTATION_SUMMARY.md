## Key Features

### Engagement Scoring Algorithm

**5 Components (Weighted):**

1. **Content Creation (30%):** Avg daily posts/timeline events
   - 1 post/day = 10 points, 10+ posts/day = 100 points

2. **Interaction (25%):** Likes + comments given
   - 5 interactions/day = 50 points, 10+ = 100 points

3. **Social Graph (20%):** Followers count
   - 100 followers = 50 points, 500+ = 100 points

4. **Consistency (15%):** Days active in last 30 days
   - 15 days = 50 points, 25+ days = 100 points

5. **Quality (10%):** Avg engagement per post + trending posts
   - 5 likes/post = 50 points, 20+ = 100 points
   - +10 points per trending post

**Total Score:** Weighted sum (0-100 scale)

**Tier Assignment:**
- ELITE: 80-100
- HIGH: 60-79
- MEDIUM: 30-59
- LOW: 10-29
- INACTIVE: 0-9

### Trending Detection Algorithm

**Engagement Velocity:** (Likes + Comments + Shares in last 24h) / Hours since creation

**Velocity Weight:**
- >100 engagements/hour: 3.0x multiplier
- >50 engagements/hour: 2.0x multiplier
- >10 engagements/hour: 1.5x multiplier
- Otherwise: 1.0x multiplier

**Trending Score:** (Likes * 1.0 + Comments * 2.0 + Shares * 3.0) * Velocity Weight

**Trending Threshold:** Score >100 AND Velocity >5

### Recommendation Engine

**4 Strategies (Multi-criteria ranking):**

1. **Similar Engagement (60% weight):** Users in same engagement tier with high scores
2. **Similar Interests (variable weight):** Users who engaged with same content (2 points per shared interest)
3. **Trending Creators (variable weight):** Users with 2+ trending posts in last 7 days
4. **Consistent Creators (variable weight):** Users with 7+ consecutive active days

**Final Score:** Sum of all strategy scores, prefer users matching multiple criteria

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- SQL schema design (well-tested patterns)
- Stored procedure logic (comprehensive validation)
- Cloud Functions structure (follows existing patterns)
- Scheduled job timing (non-overlapping schedules)

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Engagement score algorithm (may need tuning based on real data)
- Trending threshold (may need adjustment per platform activity level)
- Recommendation quality (depends on user activity patterns)
- Performance at scale (need to validate with production data)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Configurable thresholds (can adjust without redeployment)
- Monitoring dashboards for early issue detection
- Rollback procedures documented
- Performance benchmarks before production
